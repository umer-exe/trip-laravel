## 📋 Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
- Composer
- Node.js & NPM
- MySQL or PostgreSQL database
- Laravel 12.x

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umer-exe/trip-laravel
cd trip-laravel
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate
```

### 4. Configure Database

The application is pre-configured to use **SQLite**. No complex database setup is required.

1. The `.env` file should already have `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`.


> **Note**: If you encounter a "driver not found" error, enable the extension in your `php.ini` file by removing the semicolon `;` from the line `;extension=pdo_sqlite`. (usually enabled by default).
> To find your `php.ini` file, run: `php --ini`

### 5. Run Migrations & Seeders

### 5. Run Migrations & Seeders

This command will create the database tables and populate them with sample data.

1. **Run Migrations**: This will set up the database structure.
   - If the database file doesn't exist, Laravel will ask if you want to create it. Type `yes`.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

2. **Seed Data**: This creates the Admin User and sample content.

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't run `--seed`, you will NOT have an admin account to log in with.

**What the seeder creates:**
- ✅ **Admin User**: `admin@atlastours.pk` / `password123`
- ✅ **8 Sample Tours**: Mix of domestic and international tours
- ✅ **6 Customer Reviews**: Sample testimonials
- ✅ **4 Contact Messages**: Sample inquiries

### 6. Create Storage Symlink

```bash
# Create symbolic link for public storage
php artisan storage:link
```

This is **required** for image uploads to work properly. It creates a symlink from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`.

### 7. Build Frontend Assets

```bash
# Development build with hot reload (optional)
npm run dev 

# OR Production build (for deployment)
npm run build
```

### 8. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start Laravel development server
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🔐 Admin Access

### Default Admin Credentials

After running `php artisan db:seed`, you can login with:

- **Email**: `admin@atlastours.pk`
- **Password**: `password123`

### Login to Admin Panel

1. Visit `http://localhost:8000/login`
2. Use the credentials above
3. Access admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/tours`

## 🔍 AJAX Live Search Feature

### How It Works

The live search feature provides real-time tour results as users type in the destination field.

**Location**: `/tours` page (filter bar)

**Functionality**:
1. Type in the "Destination" search box
2. Results appear in a dropdown after 300ms (debounced)
3. Search filters by tour title AND location
4. Optionally filters by min/max price if set
5. Click any result to navigate to tour detail page
6. Dropdown hides when input is empty or clicking outside

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Backend**: `SiteController@searchTours` method
- **Route**: `GET /tours/search/ajax`
- **Frontend**: `resources/js/search.js`
- **Returns**: JSON array of matching tours (max 10 results)

### Testing the Search

1. Navigate to `/tours`
2. Type "Tokyo" or "Pakistan" in the destination field
3. Watch the dropdown appear with matching results
4. Set a price range and search again to see filtered results

### Feature Overview

Admin users can upload featured images and gallery images for tours with instant preview before submission.

**Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, JPG, WEBP  
**Featured Image Max Size**: 1MB  
**Gallery Images**: Up to 4 images, 1MB each  
**Storage**: `storage/app/public/tours/`

#### Creating a New Tour

1. Login to admin panel
2. Navigate to **Admin > Tours > Create Tour**
3. Fill in tour details
4. Scroll to "Featured Image Upload" section
5. Click "Choose File" and select an image (max 1MB)
6. **Preview appears instantly** below the file input
7. Optionally, upload **Gallery Images** (Select up to 4 images AT ONCE, max 1MB each)
8. Complete other fields and click "Create Tour"

#### Editing Existing Tour

1. Navigate to **Admin > Tours**
2. Click "Edit" on any tour
3. Existing featured image and gallery images are displayed in preview area
4. To replace featured image: select new file (old image is automatically deleted)
5. To replace gallery images: select new files (Select all 4 images at once - replaces all previous images)
6. Click "Update Tour"

### Image Display

Uploaded images are displayed in:
- **Admin Tours Index**: Featured image thumbnail in table
- **Public Tours Listing**: Featured image on tour cards on `/tours` page
- **Tour Detail Page**: Featured image as hero image on `/tours/{slug}` page
- **Tour Detail Page Gallery**: Gallery images displayed in a grid on `/tours/{slug}` page

### Technical Details

- Images stored in `storage/app/public/tours/`
- Database fields: 
  - `featured_image` (stores relative path to featured image)
  - `gallery_images` (JSON array storing paths to gallery images)
- Fallback: Uses `thumbnail_image` or `banner_image` if `featured_image` not set
- **FileReader API** used for client-side preview
- Validation:
  - Featured Image: `image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,webp|max:1024` (1MB)
  - Gallery Images: `array|max:4` with each image `image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,webp|max:1024` (1MB)

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication

## Feature Branches: AI Chatbot

I also have an AI chatbot integrated into the project for experimental and learning purposes in the `feature/ai-chatbot` branch.  

**Overview:**  
- Provides a conversational travel assistant for Atlas Tours & Travel.  
- Implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Groq LLM + FAISS + HuggingFace embeddings.  
- Fine-tuned to give concise answers, provide detailed info on request, and handle irrelevant questions gracefully.  
- Frontend integrated with Laravel, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.  

For setup instructions, running the chatbot locally, and testing, please see the [Chatbot-Setup-README.md] in the `feature/ai-chatbot` branch.
